# ðŸ”¥ RSA 2025 Technology Deep Dive: Auth0 + AI Assistants

## 1. Identity Layer: Auth0 Identity Platform

- Auth0 authenticates users (social login, federated enterprise login, etc.)
- User sessions are managed with strong security (OIDC/OAuth2).
- Auth0 tokens provide delegated access to external services (e.g., Google Calendar).

**Live Examples:**
- Fetch user profile details securely (`/userinfo` endpoint).
- Bind Google Calendar access to user sessions.
- Tie user context (org, email, name) into AI assistant prompts.

## 2. Authorization Layer: Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)

- Access to sensitive RAG documents is protected using FGA relationships â€” **not just login status**.
- Public documents (basic advice) are marked with `public_viewer` relation (open to everyone).
- Sensitive documents (advanced advice, competitive analysis) require users to accept Terms first.
- Dynamic relationship checks at query time â€” no hardcoded roles or ACLs.

**Live Examples:**
- Basic retirement advice accessible immediately (public).
- Advanced retirement strategies gated by accepting financial terms (policy-based dynamic access).
- Competitive business documents gated similarly in Sales Assistant.

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): CIBA (OAuth2 Backchannel Authentication Pattern)

- When AI assistants need to perform sensitive actions (e.g., scheduling a meeting), they trigger a CIBA-style async approval request.
- Users receive a binding message and explicitly approve or deny.
- If user declines, operation is safely canceled.

**Live Examples:**
- Booking events with friends or business partners triggers async approval.
- User must approve from mobile app or web notification.

## 4. AI Layer: Assistants Powered by Auth0 + OpenAI

- AI agents are configured with dynamic system prompts tailored to the userâ€™s profile and current organization.
- Secure tool integrations (`user-info`, `google-calendar-view`, `calendar-ciba`, `get-retirement-advice`, `accept-financial-terms`, etc.).
- Assistants understand how to guide users through permission flows, retry searches after new authorizations.

**Live Examples:**
- "Who am I?" triggers fetching identity via Auth0 session tokens.
- "Schedule dinner tomorrow" triggers calendar booking with approval.
- "Help me plan my retirement" triggers a secure financial RAG search and policy enforcement.

## 5. Developer Experience: Built for Simplicity and Power

- Next.js 15.3.1 app using App Router (`src/app` structure).
- Modular file layout for tools, prompts, routes, hooks, and auth.
- Pre-built scripts (`fga:init`, `fga:validate`) to seed and verify FGA state easily.
- Local vector store for fast RAG searches with OpenAI embeddings.
- Minimal dependencies: `@auth0/nextjs-auth0`, `@openfga/sdk`, `@ai-sdk/react`, `@auth0/ai-vercel`.

# âœ¨ Why This Matters

âœ… Move beyond "GenAI for anyone" to **"Secure GenAI for YOUR users, YOUR data, YOUR policies."**  
âœ… Deliver context-aware, compliance-ready AI experiences with minimum friction.  
âœ… Enable dynamic governance without developer redeploys (FGA tuples update access in real time).
