# Advanced Retirement Planning Strategies

These tactics are **beyond** the basics: they require tailoring to your personal goals, tax situation, and retirement timetable.


## 1. Catch-Up Contributions  
If you’re age 50 or older, you can make extra contributions to:  
- **401(k)**: +\$7,500/year (in addition to the standard limit)  
- **IRA**: +\$1,000/year  
- **HSA**: +\$1,000/year  
These “catch-up” deposits supercharge your savings in the critical final years before retirement.


## 2. Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Ordering  
When you retire, draw down in this order to minimize lifetime taxes:  
1. **Taxable brokerage accounts** (gains already taxed)  
2. **Tax-deferred accounts** (traditional IRAs/401(k)s)  
3. **Tax-free accounts** (Roth IRAs/HSAs)


## 3. Partial Roth Conversions  
In years with unusually low income (e.g., early retirement gap), convert a slice of traditional IRA funds into Roth. You pay tax now at a lower bracket, then enjoy **tax-free** growth and withdrawals later.



## 4. Portfolio Rebalancing & Risk Management  
As you near retirement, gradually shift from equity-heavy to more conservative holdings:  
- **30–50 years out**: 80/20 stocks/bonds  
- **10–20 years out**: 60/40 stocks/bonds  
- **In retirement**: 40/60 stocks/bonds or use a “bucket” approach


## 5. Social Security Timing  
Delaying your claim from full retirement age (FRA) up to age 70 increases your benefit by roughly 8% per year. Each year of delay is a guaranteed return that often beats safe-bond yields.
